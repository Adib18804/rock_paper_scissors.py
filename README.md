Rock, Paper, Scissors Game ü™®üìÑ‚úÇÔ∏è
This is a simple console-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game written in Python. It's a great project for beginners to learn about basic programming concepts like loops, conditional statements, and user input.

Features
Interactive Gameplay: Play against the computer in a classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

Score Tracking: The game keeps track of your score and the computer's score.

Simple Interface: A clean and easy-to-use text-based interface.

Replay Option: Play multiple rounds until you decide to quit.

How to Play
Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the command below.

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/rock-paper-scissors-game.git
(Note: Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username.)

Navigate to the Project Directory: Change your current directory to the cloned repository.

Bash

cd rock-paper-scissors-game
Run the Game: Execute the Python script from your terminal.

Bash

python rock_paper_scissors.py
Make Your Choice: Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors).

View Results: The game will display the computer's choice and the result of the round.

Play Again: You can choose to play another round or quit the game.

How it Works
The game uses a while True loop to allow continuous play. The computer's choice is determined using the random module, which randomly selects an item from a list of choices.

Conditional logic (if, elif, else statements) is used to compare the user's choice with the computer's choice to determine the winner of each round based on the rules of the game:

Rock beats Scissors

Scissors beats Paper

Paper beats Rock

The scores are updated accordingly after each round. The game ends when the user decides to quit by typing 'q' or 'n'.

Future Improvements
Add a best-of-five or best-of-seven match mode.

Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or Pygame.

Store high scores in a file to track the best players.
